This repo contains the code files (.ipynb) and word files (.docx) generated in writing a mock research article for using RNNs in Weather prediction with Big data.

Data was sourced from data.gov.

The report for this project is presented in the IEEE format for a research article.

To demonstrate that the use of deep learning methods with big data platforms, the data was copied to a hadoop distributed file system, read in and processed with Apache Spark on a Linux OS using the ubuntu virtual machine.

A simpleRNN and LSTM were compared in their ability to predict a months worth of temperature data from Knock Airport. The SimpleRNN had the highest accruracy.

A detailed introduction, methodology, discussion and conclusion is provided in the report file.
